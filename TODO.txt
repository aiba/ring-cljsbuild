* allow specifying different output filename than "main.js"
* option to do a clean build
* redirect stdout to clojure.tools.logging so compile errors appear in logs
* better exception handling.  what happens if there's a cljs compile error?  what should be served?

* implement our own filesystem tracking:
    * start recompilation as soon as a file changes.
    * debounce by 5ms in case a lot of files change simultaneously.
    * should be able to reduce latency on serving files by not calling (compile!)

* source maps?

* where do :incremental and :assert go?
