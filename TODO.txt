  parallelize different builds? (compile-lock* is per wrap-cljsbuild)

  update readme:
    mention ionotify advantage
    mention parallelizing builds?
    mention logging feature

MISC:

  option to do a clean build

DONE:

X redirect stdout logs to clojure.tools.logging
X allow specifying different output filename than "main.js"

X filesystem tracking:
  X   start recompilation as soon as a file changes.
  X   debounce by 5ms in case a lot of files change simultaneously.
  X   should be able to reduce latency on serving files by not calling (compile!)

X clean up logging-writer implementation; remove logging-print-stream.
X where do :incremental and :assert go?
X compare speeds vs. lein-cljsbuild
X option to use clojure.toolgs.logging/with-logs
X test source maps
X start a compile first time immediately after wrap called.
X strip out ANSI color sequences when using with-logs
X automatically clear watches on a directory when a new one is set up
X     remove clear-builds!
