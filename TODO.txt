TODO:

  clean up logging-writer implementation; remove logging-print-stream.

MISC:

  exception handling:
      what happens if there's a cljs compile error?  what should be served?

  option to do a clean build
  source maps?
  where do :incremental and :assert go?

DONE:

X redirect stdout logs to clojure.tools.logging
X allow specifying different output filename than "main.js"

X filesystem tracking:
  X   start recompilation as soon as a file changes.
  X   debounce by 5ms in case a lot of files change simultaneously.
  X   should be able to reduce latency on serving files by not calling (compile!)
