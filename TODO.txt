X redirect stdout logs to clojure.tools.logging
X allow specifying different output filename than "main.js"

X filesystem tracking:
  X   start recompilation as soon as a file changes.
  X   debounce by 5ms in case a lot of files change simultaneously.
  X   should be able to reduce latency on serving files by not calling (compile!)
